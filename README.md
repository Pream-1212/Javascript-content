datatypeandvariables.js → Variables and type usage.

variables.js → Declaring variables with var, let, and const.

mathsObjects.js → Using JavaScript Math objects.

functions.js → Creating and calling functions.

index.html / index.js → Starter files for running JS in browser.

ex.js →EXAMPLE EXERCISES.

Week 2 – Core JavaScript Practice

variables.js → Revisiting variable scope.

functions.js → More on functions and returns.

math.js → Arithmetic and mathematical operations.

 Week 3 – DOM, EVENTS AND STORAGE

dom1.js → DOM manipulation.

loops.js → Iterations (for, while, do...while).

ternaryOperator.js → Conditional shorthand.

events.html / events.js → Handling browser events.

forms-and-tables.html / .js → Creating and validating forms/tables.

formErrorHandling.js / .css → Client-side error handling.

LocalStorage&sessionStorage.js → Browser storage.

 Week 4 – ADVANCED JAVASCRIPT CONCEPTS

const.js → Constants in JS.

export.js → ES6 Modules (import/export).

encapsulation.js → Encapsulation in OOP.

oops.js / oops.html → Object-Oriented Programming.

asynchronous.js → Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await.

 HOW TO USE 

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Pream-1212/Javascript-content.git
